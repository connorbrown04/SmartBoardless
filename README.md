# SmartBoardless
This is a fork of the project my teammate (Aidanjm13) and I submitted for the 2023 Laf-Lehigh Rivalry Hackathon. Our project is a cost effective alternative to the SMART Boards seen in many schools today, this allows for more students to learn in an effective, engaging, and modern environment.

This project uses two cameras on any surface and turns it into a touchscreen. In combination with a projector it enables many new and adaptable ways to teach compared to a regular whiteboard. A user only has to point a specialized pen between the cameras and its position will be tracked on their computer. The system uses USB Windows-compliant HID protocols, enabling it to work on any computer running windows 8 or later without any additional client-side software, allowing for true plug and play capabilities. Our setup uses two USB cameras and a raspberry pi 4 model B. The cameras track the position of three color-markers on the pen, bright pink, blue, and lime green. The Raspberry Pi runs all of the code for the photo recognition software and sends the data to the host computer to act as a touchscreen.
